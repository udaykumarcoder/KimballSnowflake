PROJECT-4:Retail Data Warehouse Design using Dimensional Modeling
----------
Problem Statement:
-------------------
A multinational retail company operates 250 retail stores across India,
serving millions of customers every year. Every day, each branch 
generates thousands of sales transactions involving customers, products,
store locations, and billing information. The operational databases 
are primarily designed to support day-to-day business activities such 
as sales processing, inventory management, customer registration, 
product management, and billing.

As the business has grown, the management team has found it increasingly 
difficult to generate analytical reports directly from the operational databases. Complex business queries take a long time
 to execute, and decision-makers are unable to obtain timely insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product 
 demand.


To overcome these challenges, the company has decided to build a 
Retail Data Warehouse that will consolidate data from multiple 
operational systems into a centralized analytical repository. 
The data warehouse will enable management to perform historical 
analysis, identify business trends, evaluate branch performance, 
monitor customer purchasing behavior, and support strategic business 
decisions.

As a Data Warehouse Architect, your responsibility is to analyze the 
business requirements and design an efficient Dimensional Data Model 
that supports high-performance analytical queries. You must identify 
the business process, determine the appropriate Fact Table and 
Dimension Tables, define measures and grain, establish relationships 
among entities, and prepare a dimensional model suitable for business 
intelligence applications.

Business Requirements
---------------------
The management wants the Data Warehouse to generate the following 
analytical reports:

Customer-wise Sales Report
Product-wise Revenue Report
Branch-wise Sales Report
Monthly Revenue Report
State-wise Revenue Report
Category-wise Revenue Report
Top 10 Customers based on Total Sales
Top 10 Products based on Revenue
Top 10 Performing Branches
Sales Trend Analysis
Customer Purchase Analysis
Product Performance Dashboard
Branch Performance Dashboard
Regional Sales Analysis
Quarterly Revenue Analysis
